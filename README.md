# World of Analytics

This a personal website for John Thompson designed to be a hub for all analytics related matters.

## Local Development

You will need to clone this git repository to your local machine and have node.js installed. I am developing on node v14.15.4. 
  
From there you will need to run these commands both in /api and /client folders  
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will run both the express backend and react frontend on localhost:9000 and localhost:3000 respectively.
Unless you are a trusted developer with credentials, you will need to run your own local mongoDB instance and provide separate email credentials as this app relies on a production DB and email address.
